# JavaScript Homework 05 (GoIT Neoversity) – Array Iterative Methods

## Project Overview  
This project is a set of JavaScript exercises from GoIT Neoversity.

The main goal is to practice working with arrays and modern array methods (map, filter, reduce, toSorted, includes).

The main tasks of each function are:

**Task 1.** Create a function getUserNames(users) that returns an array of names of all users (property name).

**Task 2.** Create a function getUsersWithFriend(users, friendName) that returns an array of all users who have a given friend in their friends array.

**Task 3.** Create a function sortByDescendingFriendCount(users) that returns an array of users sorted in descending order by the number of friends.

**Task 4.** Create a function getTotalBalanceByGender(users, gender) that returns the total balance of users whose gender matches the given parameter.

## File Structure  
Each task is implemented in a separate file inside the project folder:  

goit-js-hw-05/ 

├── js/  
│ ├── task-1.js  
│ ├── task-2.js   
│ ├── task-3.js  
│ └── task-4.js  
├── index.html  
├── .gitignore  
├── .prettierrc  
└── README.md  

## How to Run  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Click on GitHub Pages link in description to this project.  
3. Open the browser console (DevTools → Console) to see the results of function calls.  

## Conclusions

- Practiced array iteration methods (map, filter, reduce, toSorted, includes).

- Learned to combine array methods into method chains.

- Improved ability to transform and sort data structures.

- Understood how to implement practical data manipulation tasks in JavaScript.
